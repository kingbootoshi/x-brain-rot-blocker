# X Brain Rot Blocker

A Chrome extension that blocks X (Twitter) and forces you to be intentional about your usage.

**"STOP RIGHT THERE, CRIMINAL SCUM!"** - plays every time you try to access X.

## Features

- **Full-screen blocker** when you visit x.com
- **Three modes**:
  - **POSTING** - Takes you directly to compose. No distractions.
  - **REPLYING** - View only your own posts to reply to comments
  - **DOOMSCROLLING** - Get 60 seconds. Solve a captcha to start. Solve another to extend.
- **Timer that keeps running** even if you close the tab (no cheating)
- **Sound effect** because you need to be shamed

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`
3. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in top right)
4. Click **Load unpacked**
5. Select the `x-brain-rot-blocker` folder

## How It Works

Every time you visit x.com, you'll be greeted with a black screen asking what you're there for:

- **POSTING**: Redirects you to the compose page. No feed, no distractions.
- **REPLYING**: Shows only your tracked posts so you can respond to comments.
- **DOOMSCROLLING**: You get 60 seconds. A timer shows in the corner. When it expires, you're blocked again and must solve a math captcha to continue.

## Screenshots

The blocker screen appears with a warning triangle and three buttons. Choose wisely.

## Why?

Because doomscrolling is a disease and sometimes you need an intervention.
